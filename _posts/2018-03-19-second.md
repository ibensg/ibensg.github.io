<H3> Aesthetica Sphere (from Aesthetica 2015)</H3>
Christopher Marley uses some of the most brightly coloured insects of the world, including flies, moths, butterflies and beetles. They are delivered and then very carefully treated so they keep their colour. Then Marley positions them and glues the 3D bugs down.

 He started the Aesthetica project in 2015 for the purpose that “No matter how sated or jaded a naturalist may become, there forever remains a wealth of undiscovered in nature.”. He means that our world is still a mystery even if we are satisfied that we know enough. He wants everyone to keep discovering. The form of this artwork is very variable however the bugs are all fragile and brightly coloured.  The mood is chaotic however the colours and scale organised into a neat composition making the art centred. I like the concept of the art however I do not like this artwork very much. Even though the textures are very nice to look at and the pattern is very eye catching, I would not want real bugs hanging on my wall- even if it is proven his work does not damage their populations.
